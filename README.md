# maps_and_data

This repo contains various shapefiles depicting Western Balkans countries, as well as electoral results from various election cycles. The reason I am publishing them here is that data gets lost if you don't store it in a reputable - long lasting repo.

*NOTE* This data is given as is, with no garantee of validity, I am not the author of the JSON files, all have been derived from (https://gadm.org/maps.html), while the electoral results stem from scraping government websites. If you run into any data issues please let me know and I will try and fixe them, or submit a pull request.
